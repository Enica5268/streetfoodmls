    <p class="word">
        Char Kway Teow, a popular Malaysian and Singaporean noodle dish, originally developed and catered to
        overseas-born Chinese labourers in the Southeast Asia region, the dish has achieved widespread popularity within
        the region from the late 20th century onwards, particularly in Malaysia and Singapore. The dish has also
        acquired a reputation of being unhealthy due to its high saturated fat content, as it is traditionally
        stir-fried in pork fat with crisp croutons of pork lard.

        <br><br>

        In Penang, one of Malaysia‚Äôs famous food capitals, Char Kway Teow is traditionally fried using duck eggs, which
        gives the dish a richer flavor and silkier texture due to the higher fat content of duck eggs. This is
        considered a signature touch of Penang-style Char Kuey Teow.

        In contrast, in most other regions of Malaysia or Singapore, the dish is more commonly prepared using chicken
        eggs, which are milder in taste and more widely available. While both versions are delicious, Penang‚Äôs use of
        duck eggs is often praised by food lovers as a premium or more authentic version.

        <br><br>

        The dish was often sold by fishermen, farmers and cockle-gatherers who doubled as char kway teow hawkers in the
        evening to supplement their income. The high fat content and low cost of the dish made it attractive to these
        people as it was a cheap source of energy and nutrients.

        <br><br>

        The term "char kway teow" is a transliteration of the Chinese characters ÁÇíÁ≤øÊ¢ù (in simplified Chinese ÁÇíÁ≤øÊù°). The
        dish's name is Hokkien (chh√°-k√≥e-ti√¢u?), but the dish may have its roots in Chaozhou in China's Guangdong
        province and is mostly associated with the Teochew. The word k√≥e-ti√¢u (literally meaning "ricecake strips")
        generally refers to flat rice noodles, which are the usual ingredient in Singapore and West Malaysia. There is
        no fixed way of spelling chh√°-k√≥e-ti√¢u, and many variants can be found: examples include "char kueh teow", "char
        kuey teow", "char koay teow", "char kueh tiao", "char kuay tiaw", "char kueh tiaw" and so on.

        <br><br>

        Owing to the dish's popularity and spread to Cantonese-speaking areas, the term "char kway teow" has been
        corrupted into "ÁÇíË≤¥ÂàÅ" (Cantonese Yale: ch√°au gwai dƒ´u; pinyin: ch√°o gu√¨ diƒÅo) when presented in the
        aforementioned areas. The term "Ë≤¥ÂàÅ" has no real meaning, but its pronunciation in Cantonese and Mandarin is
        similar to "Á≤øÊ¢ù" in Min Nan.
