        Nasi lemak is a dish originating in Malay cuisine that consists of rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf.
        It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish. It is also a native dish in
        neighbouring areas with significant ethnic Malay populations, such as Singapore and Southern Thailand. In
        Indonesia, it can be found in parts of Sumatra, especially the Malay regions of Riau, Riau Islands, and
        Medan. It is considered an essential dish for a typical Malay-style breakfast. Traditionally, it is served with
        sambal (spicy chili paste), fried anchovies (ikan bilis), peanuts, cucumber slices, and boiled egg.

        <br><br>

        Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, prepared by Filipino Moros, as well as in
        Australia's external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

        <br><br>

        History and background
        Nasi lemak was mentioned as early as 1875 in a Frenchâ€“Malay dictionary compiled by Pierre-Etienne-Lazare
        Favre, a Roman Catholic missionary based on the Malay peninsula, and in a book titled The Circumstances of
        Malay Life, written by Richard Olaf Winstedt in 1909. With roots in Malay culture and cuisine, the name
        of the dish in Malay literally means "fat rice" but is taken in this context to mean "rich", or
        "creamy". This is derived from the cooking process, which involves soaking the rice in coconut cream and
        steaming the mixture. The addition of pandan leaves give the rice its distinct flavour.

        <br><br>

        Nasi lemak is traditionally wrapped in banana leaves.
        Traditionally, nasi lemak is wrapped and served in banana leaves, together with a hot spicy sauce (sambal) and
        various garnishes, including fresh cucumber slices, fried anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts, and
        hard-boiled or fried eggs.

        <br><br>

        As a more substantial meal, nasi lemak may also be served with an additional protein dish such as ayam goreng
        (fried chicken), sambal sotong (cuttlefish in chili), small fried fish, cockles, and rendang daging (beef stewed
        in coconut milk and spices). Other accompaniments include stir-fried water convolvulus (kangkong)
        and spicy pickled vegetable salad (acar).
